# Why Pattern LeetCode-Patterns?

- Learn Patterns NOT Code 
- Work Smart NOT Hard
- Why solve 2000+ LC problems when you can ONLY solve 75-200 LeetCode patterns?

## Two curated List of LeetCode-Patterns:
- Blind-75:
    * Blind-75 are 75 LeetCode problems created by Tech-Leads and most widely accepted by the community from leetcode and are the most commonly used leetcode problems.

-  Comprehensive-List:
    * Comprehensive-List is an extensive list of ~200 LeetCode problems I picked up from leetcode. It includes all the common LeetCode patterns from Blind 75 and some extra additions to practice.
